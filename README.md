# SentimentAnalyzer
I developed a basic program for carrying out sentiment analysis on a few demo datasets, using the NLTK library.
As part of this project, i carried out a decent amount of data preprocessing that involved the following:
- Tokenizing the text
- Removing the stop words
- Lemmatizing the tokens

This project is a part of a another product I am working on that implents sentiment analysis.
This model has an average accuracy of about 79% that I hope to improve, when used as part of my product.
